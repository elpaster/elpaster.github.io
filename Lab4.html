            Overview

          </h2>
          <p>
            Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal or crepuscular birds in the family Caprimulgidae /ˌkæprɪˈmʌldʒɪdiː/ and order Caprimulgiformes, characterised by long wings, short legs, and very short bills. They are sometimes called bugeaters, their primary source of food being insects. Some New World species are called nighthawks. The English word nightjar originally referred to the European nightjar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nightjars are found all around the world, with the exception of Antarctica, and certain island groups such as the Seychelles. They can be found in a variety of habitats, most commonly open country with some vegetation. They usually nest on the ground, with a habit of resting and roosting on roads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nightjars have small feet, long pointed wings, and plumage patterns that camouflage them during the day. Many possess contrasting pale patches that aid communication among species.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Nightjars belong to the order Caprimulgiformes, now restricted to this family after reclassification of related groups. They are divided into subfamilies such as Caprimulginae (typical nightjars) and Chordeilinae (nighthawks).
          </p>
          <p>
            Molecular studies have clarified relationships among genera, and ongoing research continues to refine nightjar taxonomy.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Nightjars inhabit all continents other than Antarctica, as well as many islands such as Madagascar and the Caribbean. They prefer open country with scattered vegetation but can adapt to deserts, forests, and grasslands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some species migrate seasonally; for example, the European nightjar travels from Europe to Central Africa in winter.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Nightjars face threats from habitat loss, light pollution, and collisions with vehicles due to their habit of roosting on roads. Many species are classified as least concern, but some are endangered due to declining populations.
