                <h2><span class="section-icon material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">favorite</span>The Moral Imperative</h2>
                <p>Access to information is a <strong>fundamental human right</strong>. When we build websites that exclude people with disabilities, we're not just creating bad user experiences—we're denying people access to education, employment, healthcare information, social connections, and civic participation.</p>
                
                <p>Consider this: a person who is blind should be able to read the news, a deaf student should be able to watch educational videos, someone with motor impairments should be able to shop online, and someone with cognitive differences should be able to navigate government services. <em>These aren't special accommodations—they're basic rights.</em></p>
    
                <h3>Everyone Benefits</h3>
                <p>Universal Design isn't just for people with permanent disabilities. We all benefit from accessible design:</p>

                        <h4>Temporary Impairments</h4>
                        <p>Broke your arm? Captions help when you can't use headphones. Good color contrast helps when you have an eye infection.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="benefit-card">
                        <h4>Situational Limitations</h4>
                        <p>Bright sunlight making your screen hard to read? Holding a baby while browsing? Accessible design helps everyone in challenging situations.</p>

                        <p>As we age, our vision, hearing, dexterity, and cognitive abilities change. Building accessible sites means building for future you.</p>

                <h2><span class="section-icon material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">trending_up</span>The Business Case</h2>
                <p>Beyond the moral reasons, there are compelling business incentives for embracing universal design:</p>
    
                <h3>Expanded Market Reach</h3>
                <p>People with disabilities represent a market of over <strong>$13 trillion in annual disposable income globally</strong>. By making your site accessible, you're opening your business to millions of potential customers who are currently excluded.</p>
    
                <h3>Better SEO</h3>
                <p>Many accessibility practices directly improve search engine optimization. Proper heading structure, descriptive alt text, semantic HTML, and fast load times all help both screen readers and search engines understand your content.</p>
    
                <h3>Legal Protection</h3>
                <p>Web accessibility lawsuits are increasing dramatically. In 2023 alone, thousands of businesses faced legal action for inaccessible websites. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to websites, and courts are increasingly ruling in favor of accessibility.</p>
    
                <h3>Improved User Experience for All</h3>
                <p>Accessible websites tend to have clearer navigation, better organized content, faster load times, and work better on all devices. <em>Good accessibility is good design.</em></p>
            </article>
    
            <!-- The Technical Excellence -->
            <article class="argument-section" tabindex="0">
                <h2><span class="section-icon material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">code</span>The Technical Case</h2>
                <p>Building accessible websites makes you a <strong>better developer</strong>. Here's why:</p>
    
                <h3>Semantic HTML Forces Better Structure</h3>
                <p>When you use proper HTML elements instead of div soup, your code becomes more maintainable, easier to style, and naturally more accessible. It's not more work—it's better work.</p>
    
                <h3>Keyboard Navigation Improves Architecture</h3>
                <p>Designing for keyboard navigation forces you to think through your site's logical flow and interactive elements. This results in more intuitive interfaces for everyone.</p>
    
                <h3>Testing Makes Your Site More Robust</h3>
                <p>Accessibility testing catches bugs that affect all users: missing form labels, broken links, confusing navigation, and poor error handling. Fixing these issues creates a more reliable product.</p>
    
                <h3>Future-Proof Your Code</h3>
                <p>Accessible websites work better with emerging technologies like voice interfaces, AI assistants, and new input devices. Building with standards means your site adapts to future innovations.</p>

                <h2><span class="section-icon material-symbols-outlined" aria-hidden="true">public</span>The Social Impact</h2>
                <p>Web accessibility has profound effects on society as a whole:</p>
    
                <h3>Employment Opportunities</h3>
                <p>For many people with disabilities, remote work is ideal or necessary. Accessible digital tools enable millions of talented individuals to participate in the workforce, bringing diverse perspectives and skills to companies worldwide.</p>
    
                <h3>Educational Equity</h3>
                <p>Students with disabilities deserve equal access to online learning resources. Accessible educational platforms ensure that everyone can develop their skills and reach their potential, regardless of their abilities.</p>
    
                <h3>Democratic Participation</h3>
                <p>In an increasingly digital world, civic engagement happens online. Accessible government websites, news platforms, and social media ensure that all citizens can participate in democracy.</p>
    
                <h3>Social Connection</h3>
                <p>The internet connects us. When we build inclusively, we ensure that people with disabilities can maintain relationships, join communities, and participate in the social fabric of our digital age.</p>
